            Amity is not just a group of institutions which imparts world-class
            education, but an experience where everyone associated is part of a
            dream, a mission to see that we nurture truly great leaders.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my over 30 years stay in West Germany I realised, through
            interacting with the over 6000 Europeans working for me, that we
            Indians have the intelligence, the talent and the potential to be
            the more successful people in the world. That is why we established
            the Ritnand Balved Education Foundation in 1986 to start
            institutions which will groom young future leaders to be complete,
            value-driven human beings and competent professionals with a deep
            passion for humanity. These will be the people who will lead the
            world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, we are proud that Amity is synonymous with practical,
            industryfocussed education, and attracts the best students. The fact
            that our alumni are working in the best companies across the world
            is a testament to our extremely talented faculty who inculcate, by
            example, in each student the spirit of dedication, sincerity and
            loyalty, and to all the corporates who support our mission with so
            much enthusiasm.
